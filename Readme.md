# This project is made to be transformed in a ".exe" extension file.
- When executed it joins all ".pdf" extension files in the folder in one single file.
- They are order by ASCII Value of Character.
- The name of the new file is "PDF Join by Guerra"
- <a id="raw-url" href="https://github.com/FelipeGuerra5/PDF-Joiner/raw/main/PDF%20joiner%202.0.zip">Download FILE</a>
- P.S. for convenience I hid all file, except the .exe file.

# Run it
